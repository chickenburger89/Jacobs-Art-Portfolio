        <h3 class="about">About</h3>
        <p>Avalanche 2 is a game built using the P5.play Javascript library. Laura and I challenged ourselves to
          recreate a game we had built before but with improved graphics and gameplay. It features multiple
          selectable stages, toggleable music, and a persistent high-score list.<br><br>Recreating the gameplay of the
          original game was a fairly easy challenge to overcome. We knew roughly how we wanted it to play and feel, and
          we had learned how to research and utilize a javascript library, so we made use of P5.play. In the last game,
          we did not use any libraries and so had to program the gameplay from scratch. Using P5.play was not only
          easier to develop with, but resulted in far technically superior gameplay.</p>

        <h3 class="about">Avalanche 1</h3>
        <p>The first Avalanche game was made by Laura and I in the previous class. It was designed to be played using a
          board that can be physically tilted back and forth which controls the in-game platforms. We were not taught
          how to use libraries yet and had a limited amount of time, so the final game ended up being a bit glitchy and
          not the best controls. We both thought that we could have done better in hindsight, which led to us remaking
          it as seen above.</p>
