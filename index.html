        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="itext">From the day I was old enough to pick up a controller, video games have held a special place in
          my heart.
          There is something undeniably profound and deeply satisfying about immersing yourself in a world with a unique
          set of rules and goals. That is why I have dedicated my life to the study of everything games; their history,
          their design, and the countless diverse communities surrounding them. More specifically, I am interested in
          creating games and levels that provide an experience that is immersive, engaging, and fun.</p>
        <p class="itext">On top of a genuine love for games and interactivity, I use my technical knowledge and skills
          in HTML,
          JavaScript, UX/UI, Adobe Suite, Unreal Engine, and other programs to complete any project I set out for. I
          enjoy working on things that challenge me to either hone my prior skills or learn something new. I am
          committed to learning how to create the best possible user experiences down to the smallest details.</p>

        <h5 class="about">Early Life & Hobbies</h5>
        <p>From a young age, I have always loved to learn thanks to my parents. They taught me to appreciate and ask
          questions about the world around me, which translates into the unquenchable desire to create meaningful
          experiences I have today. I was never the most popular in school, preferring to stick to a few close friends
          throughout most of my experience. This resulted in video games being an escape for me. No matter how stressful
          things got, I could always be whisked away to my favorite worlds and experience stories and levels that had a
          profound impact on me at a young age. Although the struggles of adulthood are all too real for me today, I
          still find much comfort in games both old and new, and diving deeper into the development and design of my
          favorite games has become a passion of mine.</p>
        <p>Aside from video games, I enjoy science and nature as well as the exploration of other cultures. I love going
          to Lake Tahoe because it is a treasured family vacation spot as well as a place that is very close to nature.
          I also enjoy building and painting model kits in my free time, as it allows me to be creative and hands-on
          while also having a social aspect of sharing with friends. I also enjoy watching my favorite shows and movies.
          Some of my favorite movies are The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, No Country for Old Men, Goodfellas, and Shrek
          among many others. My favorite shows include Dragon Ball, Star Trek: The Next Generation, The Sopranos, Parks
          and Recreation, 30 Rock, and more. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and engaging in discussions
          about each of our favorite pastimes.</p>
